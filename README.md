# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects
C-Sharp Projects from PITMAN UK Course

This repository has everything basic you need about C#. From Syntax, Operators, Functions etc.
It has small projects that are commented through out the whole code and 
as well more complex projects that are fully functional.

This repository is great for understanding classes, methods, polymorphism and all
good things about object - oriented programming.

The best part is the .NET MVC apllications where awesome projets were created.
Understanding the MVC design is a must for developers who want to create complex
applications.

EntityFramework is another cool thing covered here. It shows how to build apps and
databases easy and most importantly to be fully operational and efficient.
